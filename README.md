# Hi there 👋

 My name is Alberto, a web frontend developer, software developer, and Linux enthusiast. I graduated as a mechanical engineer and found in computer science a huge passion.

## 💻 I feel quite comfortable writing code in...

As a developer, I have tried different programing languages but, I feel so confident writing code in:

- Python
- Javascript/Typescript

## 🧰 Frameworks

I like using **React.js** to build web applications with just CSS for styles. By the way, I also like **Vue** and I also use Bulma (rarely Bootstrap) for rapid development.

## ✍🏾 I'm Learning ...

I work on my CSS styles skills such as *grid* and *flexbox*. ⚒️💈<br>
On the other hand, lately, I have been interested in learning more in-depth computer stuff. That's how I've been touching languages like Rust and c++. 🦀 🧑🏾‍💻
